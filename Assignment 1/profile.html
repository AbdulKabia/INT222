        Hello there visitor, and welcome to my ‘average’ level website. I am the creator of this website that you see here. My name is Abdul Kabia. I am a first year, second semester student at Seneca@York. <br/> <br/>

Coding is something I have always aspired to do ever since I was a teen in the 9th grade. It has become a passion of mine, a passion I do not think I will ever get tired of. Throughout my life thus far, I have actually come to learn many different styles of coding and many different languages to code in, such as HTML/CSS, PHP, JavaScript, JQuery, C, C++ and many more. My love for coding started in a very simple, yet very educational language known as Turing. Turing is the very first language I learnt in the 9th grade; it is what sparked my love for coding. It helped put together the building blocks of my understanding of code and how different segments of code interact together to create programs. <br/> <br/>

After graduating from Seneca, I look to further my studies by transferring over to York University in order to achieve a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. It is with that degree that I look to pursue a job at <span class="blue">G</span><span class="red">o</span><span class="yellow">o</span><span class="blue">g</span><span class="green">l</span><span class="red">e</span>, actually. <span class="blue">G</span><span class="red">o</span><span class="yellow">o</span><span class="blue">g</span><span class="green">l</span><span class="red">e</span> is a company that has a great infrastructure; their employees get paid a great amount and are provided with great health care and other benefits. One of the reasons why I want to work for <span class="blue">G</span><span class="red">o</span><span class="yellow">o</span><span class="blue">g</span><span class="green">l</span><span class="red">e</span> is also because of where the job I am looking for is stationed at. I’m currently not happy with being in Canada; I actually want to move out of here and work at <span class="blue">G</span><span class="red">o</span><span class="yellow">o</span><span class="blue">g</span><span class="green">l</span><span class="red">e</span>’s headquarters located in San José, California. The position that I will be going for when I apply is Software Engineer. After graduating from York, I believe that I will have achieved sufficient knowledge to apply for such a position at such a company and be able to come out successful. <br/> <br/>

However, things are not always as planned in life. So if the dream of working at <span class="blue">G</span><span class="red">o</span><span class="yellow">o</span><span class="blue">g</span><span class="green">l</span><span class="red">e</span> is not one that will be successful, I will be looking for another path, perhaps one as a teacher. I will, of course, be teaching Computer Science or something related to IT. I have always believed that I would be a great teacher; I believe I will do a much better job than most of the teachers I have had in the past! <br/> <br/>

So that’s enough about me and my aspirations. Simply put, I’m nothing more than a man with a dream of becoming a great programmer and doing wonderful things with the knowledge and experience I will come to achieve in my lifetime.
